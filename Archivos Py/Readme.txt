This read me is focused on transmitting to the user certain questions to take into account when interacting with the interface.At first you must touch the "load file" button, there you can search any directory for the type of file. It is set by default to search only .wav files but it can also be extended to all types of file extensions.Next, you must choose whether it is a mono or stereo file. In case it is stereo, the interface allows to calculate the parameters of one channel at a time and you must choose which channel.Then you choose the file type and the type of filtering and smoothing. Finally, the calculate button graphs the 1k Hz band by default and calculates and locates the value of all the parameters. For the case that you want to visualize other bands in the graphs, you must display the menu on the right above, choose the band and touch, "refresh graph". Then for the case in which a third of an octave was used, the table throws a default interval and then if you want to choose the other two intervals of thirds of a band, you must choose the option in the drop-down on the right and then put "refresh table ".The "export table" button exports all bands to an .xlsx file. The order of the rows is the same as the interface table.Finally, to reduce errors, each time you want to apply different combinations of filtering or smoothing, it is advisable to touch the buttons again.# It is possible that for thirds of an octave, or for long files, the filtering and smoothing processes take a long time.Three types of files are attached to the folder:Prueba.wav = RIR monoLSS 1 Nico.wav = LSSIR 4estereo.wav = Binaural RIR
